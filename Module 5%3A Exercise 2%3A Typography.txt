Module 5: Exercise 2: Typography

ITC Stone Sans & Utopia work
Apparently they both aim for friendly functionality. It makes sense, but I personally don't feel as though I am very sensitive to all of this. I can see that there is an art to this, but I think that this art is lost on me. 

Univers & Linotype Centennial work but together they look like what you would see on a restauran menu or something.

Adobe Garamond Pro & Cronos Pro
Work as a serif (AGP) and sans serif (CP). They also seem to work well whether large or smale (as titles and tex) and italicize and bold well. 

Archer (serif) & Avenir (sans serif) also work well. I think because they also bold and italicise well and work as body text and heading rather equally.
