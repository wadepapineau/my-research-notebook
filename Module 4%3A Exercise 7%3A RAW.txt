Module 4: Exercise 7: RAW

The Alluvial Diagram displays some interesting results when all 4 places are inserted. The problem is that, for me at least, what it is telling me is not entirely clear.

Obviuosly, some of these diagrams are not appropriate for thid dataset. The one that I personaly find to be particularly telling are the Circular Dendogram, Cluster Dendogram, Reingold-Tilford Tree, and the Treemap. I think these produce very clear and legible results in terms of being able to very quickly identify an informative pattern.
