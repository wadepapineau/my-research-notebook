Module 5: Exercise 1: Inkscape

This is an interesting little program.

Having trouble with step number 10: Add a legend. I cant seem to figure out how to add text to this graphic. It i going to take some trial and error I guess. 

I have figured out how to select a font easily enough. How to apply it to the image though still evades me. 

After clicking around for a few minutes it, as is usual for me when I have issues, was so obvious it evaded me. By clicking on the "add text objects" button on the control panel on the right I am able to add a text box. It is always the most obvious things that confuse me with these exercises. 

I'm not sure of the "going firther" section of this exercise is mandatory, but for the sake of saving time I am going to leave it for now. I do appreciate what it says about making a color palette that is "color blind friendly" for the sake of accessibility.
