# Why I am Taking this Course
I am taking this course because it sounds interesting. I am not familiar with digital history and wanted to learn what this ia all about. 

I hope to gain a working knowledge of what digital history is, how it works, and how to apply its methods to other work that I am currently doing.

I am not sure what to expect from this course. My digital experience is centered both around my work in the history program as well as personal enterainment in my spare time.
